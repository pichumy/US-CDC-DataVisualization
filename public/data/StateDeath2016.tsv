Caveats:

"postcensal series released by NCHS on June 26, 2017. The population figures for year 2015 are bridged-race estimates of the July"
"1 resident population, from the Vintage 2015 postcensal series released by NCHS on June 28, 2016. The population figures for"

"2. The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group 'under 1 year' are the estimates of the"
